লক্ষ করুন, এই তালিকাটি অসম্পূর্ণ হতে পারে। কারণ অনেক ছায়াপথই পরে আবিষ্কৃত হয়েছে এবং এটি মনে করার কোন কারণও নেই যে ভবিষ্যতে আরও ছায়াপথ আবিষ্কৃত হবে না। মূলত আকাশগঙ্গার জন্যই আমরা অনেক ছায়াপথ দেখতে পারিনা এবং ছোট ক্ষীণ ছায়াপথগুলো অনেক কাছে থাকা সত্ত্বেও দেখা না যেতে পারে। '''ছায়াপথ''' '''দূরত্ব''' '''মন্তব্য''' ১. আকাশগঙ্গা ছায়াপথ পৃথিবীর মাতৃ ছায়াপথ ২.
