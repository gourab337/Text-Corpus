Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss and sent India in to bat; however his decision was quickly proved wrong. Virender Sehwag hit the first ball of the tournament for four, and he along with Sachin Tendulkar added 69 for the first wicket at over run ball until the latter was run out after mix-up. Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir then had their team cruise to 152/1, when Gambhir was bowled by Mahmudullah but that did not stop Sehwag, who cruised to his century and then rapidly accelerated along with Virat Kohli. India cruised past 300, and Sehwag posted career-best 175 before getting out, and Kohli also got his ton as India posted daunting 370/4 at the end of their 50 overs. Bangladesh started off rapidly in their chase, getting 51 runs in the first five overs without losing wicket; but soon, at the score of 56, Imrul Kayes played on to Munaf Patel delivery. Tamim Iqbal got half-century, but the Bangladesh run-rate slowed after that and they weren't in the hunt, and at the end they got to 283/9 without really challenging the Indian total. Virender Sehwag's score of 175 was his 14th ODI hundred, and the fourth highest score in the history of the Cricket World Cup. ===ইংল্যান্ড বনাম Netherlands captain Peter Borren won the toss and elected to bat first against England, one of the contenders for the trophy. Netherlands started well, with openers Alex Kervezee and Wesley Barresi going at quick pace but England fought back, getting both openers soon after; and after 33 overs, Netherlands were 149/4. Then Ryan ten Doeschate accelerated, and went on to score brilliant century, and this, coupled with very poor fielding from England, helped Netherlands plunder 104 runs off the last ten overs and lead them to strong 292/6. The English started off very strongly in their reply, getting their first 100 runs at run ball without losing wicket. Kevin Pietersen fell soon after, but Netherlands were unable to build on it. England captain Andrew Strauss closed in on century but holed out and all the England top order batsmen scored runs, with Paul Collingwood and Ravi Bopara taking England home with 1.2 overs to spare. The Netherlands score of 292 was the second highest score from an Associate nation playing against Test nation. ===দক্ষিণ আফ্রিকা বনাম ওয়েস্ট ইন্ডিজ=== South Africa, another one of the pre-tournament favorites played their first match of the tournament against West Indies team which is currently in transisition. South Africa won the toss, set West Indies in to bat, and opened the bowling with spinner Johan Botha, which was vindicated as he got the wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Darren Bravo then came into the crease and played an aggressive knock of 73, with support from Devon Smith in strong century stand until Botha trapped Bravo in front. Two quick wickets on debut by Imran Tahir left West Indies on 120/4 but counterattack from Dwayne Bravo, who was well assisted by Shivnarine Chanderpaul took West Indies to healthy 209/5 with over overs left. However, Tahir returned to get the wickets of Chanderpaul and Devon Thomas, the other set batsman before Dale Steyn cleaned up the tail to restrict the West Indies to 222. South Africa stuttered at the start of their reply, with Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis falling cheaply early on. AB de Villiers then came into the crease and counterattcked with string of boundaries, reaching his half-century at close to run-a-ball. He and captain Graeme Smith had over century partnership for the third wicket until Kieron Pollard got one through Smith's defences. This, however turned out to false dawn for West Indies, as de Villers reached his century off 97 balls, and together with JP Duminy got the remaining 84 runs with over seven overs left. AB de Villiers century was the fastest by South African in the World Cup and the South African victory was the 12th successive win against the West Indies. ===বাংলাদেশ বনাম আয়ারল্যান্ড=== Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss against Ireland and elected to bat, after conceding 370 against India after setting them in. His decision seemed to be vindicated at the start of Bangladesh's innings, with Tamim Iqbal unleashing flurry of boundaries immediately, to take Bangladesh to 49/0 after overs. Ireland needed moment of inspiration and they got it from wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien who did brilliant stumping to send Imrul Kayes on his way. Ireland quickly built on it, with direct hit from Ed Joyce catching Junaid Siddiqui short, before both Tamim and Shakib were also dismissed softly. Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan staged recovery then, and at 147/4 in the 34th over, Bangladesh looked well set for score above 250 until Mushfiqur top-edged sweep of George Dockrell. This triggered another collapse, and only late cameo from Naeem Islam took Bangladesh to 205. Ireland started off solidly in their reply, but then the Bangladesh spinners led by Shakib and Mohammad Ashraful took wickets at regular intervals. The match was evenly poised with Ireland 93/4 after 25 overs. Niall O'Brien was the key to the chase but with the score at 110, he was dismissed after brilliant catch by Tamim Iqbal. Kevin O'Brien continued to fight, taking Ireland above 150 and giving them another sniff at victory till he holed out to deep square-leg off Shafiul Islam. pumped-up Shafiul then ran through the tail, and Ireland were all out for 178, falling 27 runs short. Shafiul Islam recorded the best figures for Bangladeshi bowler in World Cup matches, with 4/21. ===ভারত বনাম ইংল্যান্ড=== Having scored 370 in their previous game, India elected to bat after winning the toss against England. Virender Sehwag, fresh from his 175 the previous game blazed away at the start of the innings, hitting rapid 35 before falling to Tim Bresnan. Sachin Tendulkar then took over the innings, and was ably assisted by Gautam Gambhir. The duo continued at very rapid pace and added 133 runs until Gambhir was bowled by Graeme Swann for 51. Tendulkar went on to get his hundred, and eventually when he did get out for 120, India were strongly placed at 236/3 in the 39th over. Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni continued on at brisk pace, with Yuvraj reaching his fifty off just 45 balls. India passed 300 in the 45th over, but then Yuvraj and Dhoni fell off consecutive balls to trigger collapse. Bresnan took three wickets in four balls to get his five-for, and India did not bat their 50 overs, being all out for 338 with ball left. England got off to very strong start in their chase, with both Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen going rapid pace. Pietersen was dismissed for 31 in freak way off Munaf Patel, but Strauss went on to get his fifty. Jonathan Trott was unable to convert start, but Strauss and Ian Bell then indulged in sensational stand of 170 runs for the third wicket. The duo also easily kept the required run rate well under control, keeping it around 7. Strauss reached his century off just 99 balls, and Bell took 45 to reach his half-century. England were 280/2 after 42 overs, when Zaheer Khan produced sensational over, getting Bell caught at mid-off for 69 and catching Strauss plumb in front for brilliant 158. Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior went cheaply, but some lusty blows from Bresnan and Swann kept England in the hunt, with 14 required off the last over. Swann managed off the first balls before Ajmal Shahzad hit six off the third to leave England with just from 3. single and two later meant that was required off the last ball with all three results possible. Swann dug the last ball from Patel away for single, which meant that the game was tied. India batted first and opener Sachin Tendulkar scored his 47th ODI century and 5th World Cup century, the highest number of centuries by anyone ever in World Cup. Support came from Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh who both made half-centuries.
